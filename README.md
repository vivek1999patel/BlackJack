### Technologies

* I have utilized HTML and CSS to build user interface with the thought of keeping it simple but decent to give users best experience with the best color combination for UI and Javascript to add the rules for the game to give the best experience to users of real game.
* I used popular Model-View-Controller(MVC) pattern to make it easy to navigate through the gameplay and render the logic smoothly in the browser.
