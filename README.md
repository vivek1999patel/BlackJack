### Technologies
---
#### I utilized HTML and CSS to build user interface to with the combination of color to make it user friendly with the thought of keeping it simple but decent. I also used JavaScript to implement game rules to make it like a real game.
#### I implemented Model-View-Controller(MVC) to make it easy to navigate through the gameplay and render game rules logic in the web browser.

#### Once the cards will be dealed to player and dealer, player will choose to hit or stand according to the points player have from the first two cards.
* If player will have less than 21 points then player can choose to hit and continue to get more cards to go closer to 21 points.
* If player will choose to stand, dealer's second card will be faced up and will be dealed with more cards to go closer to 21 points or more than player's points to win the game.
